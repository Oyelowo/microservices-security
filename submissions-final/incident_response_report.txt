1. Incident commander name:
Foo Bar

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Our system was infiltrated with malicious resources deployed within our infrastructure.
These were crypto-mining applications.

3. Summary of what was affected:
Our infrastructure resources were affected. This includes the cluster
CPU and memory utilisation which caused a sharp rise in resource consumption on our infrastructure.

4. Summmry of the impact:
This caused our applications to starve as the mining attacking appications were 
very resource demanding. This caused some of our applications to crash and thus, be unavailable temporarily.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
We were alerted by our runtime monitoring system - falco. Confirmed this from our monitoring tool - grafana. 
Thereafter, we immediately shut down those malicious applications.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
We need to have a proper authorisation system in place and have a stricter role based access control 
to prevent wider access to the cluster by default. We will be moving to the least privileged approach immediately .
