# Falco uses a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to pass
# system call information. When falco detects that this buffer is
# full and system calls have been dropped, it can take one or more of
# the following actions:
#   - "ignore": do nothing. If an empty list is provided, ignore is assumed.
#   - "log": log a CRITICAL message noting that the buffer was full.
#   - "alert": emit a falco alert noting that the buffer was full.
#   - "exit": exit falco with a non-zero rc.
#
# The rate at which log/alert messages are emitted is governed by a
# token bucket. The rate corresponds to one message every 30 seconds
# with a burst of 10 messages.

# Falco continuously monitors outputs performance. When an output channel does not allow
# to deliver an alert within a given deadline, an error is reported indicating
# which output is blocking notifications.
# The timeout error will be reported to the log according to the above log_* settings.
# Note that the notification will not be discarded from the output queue; thus,
# output channels may indefinitely remain blocked.
# An output timeout error indeed indicate a misconfiguration issue or I/O problems
# that cannot be recovered by Falco and should be fixed by the user.
#
# The "output_timeout" value specifies the duration in milliseconds to wait before
# considering the deadline exceed.
#
# With a 2000ms default, the notification consumer can block the Falco output
# for up to 2 seconds without reaching the timeout.

# A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the
# rate of falco notifications. This throttling is controlled by the following configuration
# options:
#  - rate: the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification)
#    gained per second. Defaults to 1.
#  - max_burst: the maximum number of tokens outstanding. Defaults to 1000.
#
# With these defaults, falco could send up to 1000 notifications after
# an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second
# afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of
# no activity.
